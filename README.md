# C++ example
This is just an example project to show what I know about C++.<br>
On it, I made a class "Paquete" - spanish word for "package" - and a class "Cliente" - spanish word for "client".<br>
Both of them are constructed with pointers, so that we can have a better optimization of the resources used, and we donÂ´t overload RAM unnecessarily.<br>
After, the class "Cliente" - "client" - uses the previous classes to handle what a travel agency would need to store the information of its clients.<br>
And, finally, using main.cpp, we can work with the "Cliente" class
Here there is an explanation of what each class contains
