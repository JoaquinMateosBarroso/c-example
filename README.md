# c-example
This is just an example project to show what I know about c++.
On it, I made a class "AgViajes" - spanish traduction of "travel agency" - and a class "cliente" - spanish traduction of "client".
Both of them are constructed with pointers, so that we can have a better optimization of the resources used, and we donÂ´t overload RAM unnecessarily.
After, the class "Cliente" - "client" - uses the previous classes to handle what a travel agency would need to store the information of its clients.
